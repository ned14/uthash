Version 1.3 (2008-00-00)
------------------------

	* use integer-only math-- no floating point! Support FPU-less CPU's.
	* eliminate hash_q metric, which measured the fraction of items with
	  non-ideal chain positions. We only need to know if this fraction
		is below 0.5. This is now determined using fast bitwise tests.
	* fixed a minor bug in the calculation of the max ideal chain length:
	  line 446 in v1.2 erroneously calculated a/b*2 instead of a/(b*2).
		The effect of this bug was that bucket expansion could occur more 
		readily because the per-bucket 'max chain length multiplier factor'
		(which delays bucket expansion when certain buckets are overused) 
		was set to a lower (i.e. expansion-favoring) value than intended.
	* improved source commenting and improved variable names in structures
	* remove HASH_JSW; its bulky random number array hampered code clarity

Version 1.2 (2006-11-22)
------------------------

	* new HASH_SORT macro
	* Cygwin support
	* User Guide now features a clickable Table of Contents.
		(The technique for generating the TOC on the browser was contributed
		back to the AsciiDoc project and incorporated into AsciiDoc v8.1.0).


Version 1.1 (2006-06-28)
------------------------

	* uthash-1.1 released
	* supports several built-in user-selectable hash functions
	* new keystats utility quantifies performance of hash functions


Version 1.0 (2006-06-02)
------------------------
 
	* Initial release
