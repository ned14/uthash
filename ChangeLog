Version 1.3 (2008-07-27)
------------------------

  * use integer-only math-- no floating point! Support FPU-less CPU's.
  * eliminate hash_q metric, which measured the fraction of items with
    non-ideal chain positions. We only need to know if this fraction
    is below 0.5. This is now determined using fast bitwise tests.
  * when an item is added to the hash, calculate the key's hash value
    upfront and store it, instead of recomputing it as needed. This hashv
    is stored in the hash handle. Potentially major speed benefit for
    bucket expansion algorithm. Deleting is marginally improved too.
  * fixed a minor bug in the calculation of the max ideal chain length;
    line 446 in v1.2 erroneously calculated a/b*2 instead of a/(b*2).
    The effect of this bug was that bucket expansion could occur more 
    readily because the per-bucket 'max chain length multiplier factor'
    (which delays bucket expansion when certain buckets are overused) 
    was set to a lower, expansion-favoring value than intended.
  * improved source commenting and improved variable names in structures
  * remove HASH_JSW. Lengthy random number array made code less readable
  * add HASH_SRT(hh,hash,cmp) as a generalized HASH_SORT(hash,cmp). 
    It was an omission in uthash 1.2 that there was no sort macro for
    hash handles with names other than hh.
  * Corrected HASH_FSCK so it works with any name for the hash handle.
  * behave properly in pathological HASH_DEL(a,a) case where the same
    variable references the head and the deletee (advancing the head 
    then loses the correct reference to the deletee); fix by using 
    scratch area in the hash table to store deletee hash handle.
  * made tests runnable on MinGW 
  * 3000+ downloads since uthash-1.0


Version 1.2 (2006-11-22)
------------------------

  * new HASH_SORT macro
  * Cygwin support
  * User Guide now features a clickable Table of Contents.
    (The technique for generating the TOC on the browser was contributed
    back to the AsciiDoc project and incorporated into AsciiDoc v8.1.0).


Version 1.1 (2006-06-28)
------------------------

  * uthash-1.1 released
  * supports several built-in user-selectable hash functions
  * new keystats utility quantifies performance of hash functions


Version 1.0 (2006-06-02)
------------------------
  
  * Initial release
