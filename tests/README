Automated tests for uthash
==============================================================================
Run "make" or "make debug" in this directory to build the tests and run them.
The latter usage activates the uthash internal debugging consistency checks.


test1:  make 10-item hash, iterate and print each one
test2:  make 10-item hash, lookup items with even keys, print
test3:  make 10-item hash, delete items with even keys, print others 
test4:  10 structs have dual hash handles, separate keys
test5:  10 structs have dual hash handles, lookup evens by alt key
test6:  test alt malloc macros
test7:  test alt malloc macros with 1000 structs so bucket expansion occurs
test8:  test num_items counter in UT_hash_handle
test9:  test "find" after bucket expansion
test10: dual-hash handle test, bucket expansion on one and not the other
test11: read dat file of names (all are bucket 15) into hash, induce noexpand
test12: create hash with string keys, add 10 items, lookup each item
test13: make 10-item hash, delete items with even keys, reverse print others
test14: read dat file of names into hash, read file again and lookup each one
test15: build string-keyed hash of 3 items, lookup one item 
test16: hash on aggregate key, iterate, lookup, using generalized macros
